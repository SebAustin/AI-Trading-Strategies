## Usage

### Running the Project

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder** and open `Build a momentum-based algorithmic trading program.ipynb`

3. **Run the notebook cells sequentially**:
   - Data loading and preprocessing
   - Technical indicator calculation
   - Strategy implementation
   - Backtesting and performance analysis
   - Results visualization

### Data Sources

The project utilizes:

1. **S&P 500 Data (SP500.csv)**
   - Historical price data for S&P 500 index
   - Daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
   - Used as the primary trading instrument

2. **SQLite Database (SP500.db)**
   - Processed and cleaned data storage
   - Efficient data retrieval for analysis
   - Historical performance records

### Trading Strategy

The momentum strategy implements the following logic:

1. **Signal Generation**:
   - Buy signals when momentum indicators show upward trends
   - Sell signals when momentum indicators show downward trends
   - Hold signals when trend is unclear

2. **Position Sizing**:
   - Dynamic position sizing based on volatility
   - Risk-adjusted position allocation
   - Maximum position limits

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Stop-loss orders for downside protection
   - Take-profit levels for profit realization
   - Maximum drawdown limits

### Key Parameters

- **Lookback Period**: Number of days for momentum calculation
- **Moving Average Periods**: Short and long-term moving average windows
- **RSI Thresholds**: Overbought/oversold levels
- **Position Size**: Percentage of capital per trade
- **Stop Loss**: Maximum loss per position

## Strategy Components

### Momentum Indicators

1. **Moving Averages**
   - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
   - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
   - Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

2. **Oscillators**
   - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - MACD with signal line
   - Price rate of change

3. **Volatility Indicators**
   - Bollinger Bands
   - Average True Range (ATR)
   - Historical volatility

### Trading Rules

1. **Entry Conditions**:
   - Price above moving averages
   - RSI in bullish territory
   - MACD showing positive momentum
   - Volume confirmation

2. **Exit Conditions**:
   - Price below moving averages
   - RSI in overbought territory
   - MACD showing negative momentum
   - Stop-loss or take-profit hit

3. **Risk Management**:

## Customization

### Modifying Strategy Parameters

To adjust the trading strategy:

1. **Change Lookback Periods**: Modify the number of days for indicator calculation
2. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune RSI, MACD, and other indicator levels
3. **Modify Position Sizing**: Change the percentage of capital allocated per trade
4. **Update Risk Management**: Adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels

### Adding New Indicators

To incorporate additional technical indicators:

1. Calculate the new indicator in the notebook
2. Add it to the signal generation logic
3. Include it in the backtesting framework
4. Update the performance analysis

### Using Different Data

To test with different instruments:

1. Replace `SP500.csv` with your dataset
2. Ensure data has required columns (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
3. Update data loading and preprocessing sections
4. Adjust strategy parameters for the new instrument

## Backtesting Framework

The backtesting system includes:

1. **Historical Data Simulation**: Realistic trading simulation
2. **Transaction Costs**: Incorporates realistic trading costs
3. **Slippage Modeling**: Accounts for market impact
4. **Performance Attribution**: Detailed analysis of strategy components

## Risk Management

The strategy implements several risk management features:

1. **Position Sizing**: Risk-based position allocation
2. **Stop Losses**: Automatic loss protection
3. **Maximum Drawdown**: Portfolio-level risk limits
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Diversification considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data Quality**: Check for missing values or data inconsistencies
2. **Performance Issues**: Optimize code for large datasets
3. **Memory Errors**: Use data sampling for large historical datasets
4. **Strategy Overfitting**: Use out-of-sample testing

### Performance Tips

- Use vectorized operations for faster computation
- Implement efficient data structures for large datasets
- Consider parallel processing for multiple strategy testing
